# Chess
Command line interface chess game I programmed from scratch as a personal project during summer 2021. 
Select which piece you'd like to move by entering a letter from A-H and a number from 1-8.
Do the same with where you would like to move it to.
e.g. Entering d2 and then d4 will move your piece up two spaces.
B = Black | W = White
p = Pawn | R = Rook | N = Knight | B = Bishop | Q = Queen | K = King
[] indicates a black tile
The computer opponent decides moves with a Minimax algorithm.
